# Abstract

**LTV** - the Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. 
For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.

**Health Factor** - crucial metric representing the safety of a user's borrowed position. It is calculated based on the ratio of the total collateral value 
a user has provided to the platform against the total value of assets they have borrowed. Essentially, the Health Factor indicates the level of risk associated with the user's position. 
A higher Health Factor means a safer position, reducing the likelihood of the position being liquidated. If the Health Factor falls below a certain threshold (typically 1), it signals a high risk of liquidation, 
where the user's collateral might be sold off to repay the borrowed assets. This metric helps users manage their borrowing and lending activities, 
ensuring they maintain a healthy balance between the assets borrowed and the collateral provided.

# Problems

One of the team members, who is also an educator in the field of cryptocurrencies and DeFi, encountered a significant challenge while teaching these complex subjects. During their experience of instructing over 3000 students, they consistently faced the difficulty of effectively conveying intricate DeFi concepts such as collateralization, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and the Health Factor. Traditional educational methods often proved insufficient in fully capturing the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the practical implications of these concepts.

This problem is further compounded by the abstract and often complex nature of DeFi, which can be daunting for newcomers. The educator noticed a gap in practical, interactive learning tools that could simplify and demystify DeFi for students. Many learners struggled to grasp the full extent of risk management in DeFi, particularly regarding asset collateralization and the impact of market volatility.

# Proposed solution

Recognizing these educational challenges, the team member was inspired to create a solution that could bridge this gap. The game concept was thus born out of a need for a more engaging, intuitive, and risk-free way to educate users about DeFi. By gamifying the learning experience, the game aims to make DeFi concepts more accessible and relatable, offering a hands-on approach to understanding and navigating the DeFi ecosystem. This initiative reflects a commitment to improving financial literacy in the DeFi space, empowering users to make informed decisions in their DeFi engagements.
